threex.videotexture
===================

threex.videotexture is a three.js extension which provides helpers to handle 
videos in texture.
It is possible to put html5 ```<video>``` output in texture
with ```threex.videotexture.js```.
You can even put the webcam in a texture with ```threex.webcamtexture.js```.
If you need it you can try ```threex.audiovideotexture.js``` where the
video is mapped on the texture and additionnally the sound of the video
is handled via [web audio API](http://example.com).
Thus you can have localized sound, which is neat in 3d environment.

Here is a [videotexture example](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.htmlmixer/examples/videotexture.html) and its [source](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.htmlmixer/blob/master/examples/videotexture.html).
Here is a [audio videotexture example with WebAudio API](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.htmlmixer/examples/audiovideotexture.html)and its [source](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.htmlmixer/blob/master/examples/audiovideotexture.html).
here is another [webcam example](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.htmlmixer/examples/webcam.html) and its [source](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.htmlmixer/blob/master/examples/webcam.html). 


How To Install It
=================

You can install it manually. Just do 

```html
<script src='threex.videotexture.js'></script>
```

You can install with [bower](http://bower.io/).

```bash
bower install threex.videotexture
```

then you add that in your html

```html
<script src="bower_components/threex.videotexture/threex.videotexture.js"></script>
```


How To Install it ?
===================

## threex.videotexture.js

First you instanciate the texture itself

```javascript
// create the videoTexture
var videoTexture= new THREEx.VideoTexture('videos/sintel.ogv')
updateFcts.push(function(delta, now){
	// to update the texture are every frame
	videoTexture.update(delta, now)
})
```

Then you use it in a mesh like this.
	
```javascript
// use the texture in a THREE.Mesh
var geometry	= new THREE.CubeGeometry(1,1,1);
var material	= new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
	map	: videoTexture.texture
});
var mesh	= new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );
```

Here is the detailled API:

* ```videoTexture.video```: the video dom element from which the video is used
* ```videoTexture.texture```: the generated ```THREE.Texture``` 
* ```videoTexture.update(delta, now)```: update the texture from the video element
* ```videoTexture.destroy()```: destroy the object

## threex.webcamtexture.js

It will read the webcam using [getUserMedia](http://example.com). The browser
will likely ask for permissions to the users.
Let's see how to use it. You instanciate the texture itself.

```javascript
var webcamTexture	= new THREEx.WebcamTexture()
updateFcts.push(function(delta, now){
	// to update the texture are every frame
	webcamTexture.update(delta, now)
})
```

Then you use it in a mesh

	
```javascript
// use the texture in a THREE.Mesh
var geometry	= new THREE.CubeGeometry(1,1,1);
var material	= new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
	map	: videoTexture.texture
});
var mesh	= new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( mesh );
```

Here is the detailled API:

* ```videoTexture.video```: the video dom element from which the video is used
* ```videoTexture.texture```: the generated ```THREE.Texture``` 
* ```videoTexture.update(delta, now)```: update the texture from the video element
* ```videoTexture.destroy()```: destroy the object
* ```THREEx.WebcamTexture.available```: true if ```getUserMedia``` is available on this
browser, false otherwise.
